To Install
	Unzip files somewhere ex. /Sites/cfconsole
	Login to ColdFusion Administrator
	Go to Event Gateways -> Gateway Instances
	In the Add/Edit ColdFusion Event Gateways Instances Form Set these:
		Gateway ID: 		cfconsoleTelnet
		Gateway Type:		Socket - listens on a socket
		CFC Path: 			<wherever you put them> ex. /Sites/cfconsole/gateway/telnet.cfc
		Configuration File: <wherever you put them> ex. /Sites/cfconsole/gateway/socket.cfg
		Startup Mode:		Manual
		Press Add Gateway Instance
		Then click the green Play button next to the cfconsoleTelnet instance
		An error comes up here that you cannot start the gateway.  I fixed it by running ColdFusion under sudo.
